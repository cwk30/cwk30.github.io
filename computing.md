#### A brief history on my interactions with computers
<br>
## The tale of when...
  * [I got a computer stuck in a boot loop](#bootloop)
  * [I got a portable programming machine](#gc)
  * [I picked up C, Python, and killed my laptop, thus forcing me to pick up Linux too](#longstory)
  * [I 3D modelled something](#3d)
  * [I won a prize in a coding competition in which I did not code](#yrs)
  * [I signed on and _really_ learnt how to use my computer](#work)

## It all started... 

...all the way back in Year 1 (Sec 1), when I entered NUS High. A few of us thought it would be funny to add a shortcut to shutdown.exe into a computer’s startup folder as a joke, and watch the confusion that ensued on the next unsuspecting user. It was a mischievous prank, but memorable: high school marked the first time I had regular access to a computer, and it was where the seeds were sowed.

## Then I got myself a Graphing Calculator 
I promptly realised that it doubled as a portable programming machine. I spent half my bus rides hunched over my GC, coding on the small screen: physics functions, math utilities, even text based games.

## During my senior years 
I learnt the basics to C programming, and was also introduced to my first Linux distro. Initially running Linux in a virtual environment, I went on to dual boot my laptop. However, one day, a critical failure happened of my hard disk, due to a highly unfortunate accident in which I tripped over my power cord... during the partitioning process on my machine when attempting to create a triboot. I then decided to install Linux as my main OS for a good half a year, until compatibility issues forced me to switch back to Windows.

I also went on to learn the basics of Python on my own accord, in an attempt to build my own "Search Engine". The result, however, was a very slow and definitely not very comprehensive web crawler, but it did teach me the merits of Python.

## 3D Modeling my research project 
As part of my research work, I also picked up 3D modelling on Solidworks. Find out more about my project [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/engineering).

## Young Rewired State @ Google Singapore 
In 2014, I joined a team to participate in the Young Rewired State Hackathon, held at Google Singapore, as a designer. Though not part of the programming team, it was still an eye opening experience for me, especially after we [clinched the Best Use of Code award.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150922162216/http://hacks.youngrewiredstate.org/events/yrssingapore) The project, a brainchild of ours, was to let people add and search for events near them, with the results displayed directly on a map. The project is still live [here.](http://sup-sg.appspot.com/)

## Enlistment, and then signing on in the Signals formation 
After enlisting, my passion drove me to continue down this path in the Signals formation, as an Army regular. I was trained in CCNA 1, Routing and Switching, and in the course of my work, has also set up and run various complex networks consisting of several servers with a sizable amount of clients. I went on to join my formation’s push for cyber defence, and was sent for a multitude of courses to attain the necessary skills, of which include:

* Certified Ethical Hacking
* Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator 
* Cyber Security Analyst 
* Cyber Security Incident Responder
* Cyber Security Operations Specialist.  

The last was my favourite; the final practical examination had us fending of live attacks in a virtualized network environment.
One of the attacks were as follows:  
* The first inkling of trouble was when the IDS issued an alert for suspicious web crawling activities on the web host servers.
* Initially dismissing it as a false positive, we soon found our DNS server was shutting down abruptly. 
* After restarting the server and tracing the logs, we found the culprit to be... the SQL server? 
* A subsequent investigation on the SQL server found that it was tampered with via the web host server, and it was only then we realised that we were looking at a SQL injection.  

Such attacks kept us constantly on our toes, and I learnt a great deal out of it. And yes, it was very exciting too!

## Future Thoughts
The field of Information Systems is truly fascinating, and I wish to have the chance to further my passion in this. My strong passion has led me on my knowledge pursuit, and in the future I wish to specialise in Cyber Security.
