#### A photo journey of when I built a glider, crashed it, built a RC plane, crashed it too, then took it to Japan

### What started it all  
Back in 2012, I had the opportunity to joined the YDSP World of Science Aerodynamics programme. It was a course spread over several months, held at NUS Engineering Faculty. The course culminated with a visit and flight experience at Singapore Youth Flying Club, and I certainly enjoyed my time then!

Near the end of the course, we were asked if anyone would be interested in doing a research project under the Research@YDSP programme with DSO, and I jumped at the chance. Together with 3 other group members, we embarked on this journey where we researched on constructing the most optimal glider with collapsible wings.

Our very first glider was a simple one, to understand how gliders work. This was our very first glider:

The key thing in this project was the design of the closing/opening mechanism. We drew inspiration from a very common item found in most homes: Windows. Most of us had windows that can be opened or closed, and we decided to emulate its hinge design:

We moved on from there to our first prototype with deployable wings. You can see the carbon fibre rods that formed the skeleton of our hinge mechanism here:

There was several setbacks initially, especially when our plane broke:

But it gave us the opportunity to redesign the wing such that it could close even further:

Here, we are using a software to track the moving pixels to assess the flight path of our glider.

6 months later, we were all done, and presented our project at the YDSP Research Congress.

### We were having so much fun, why stop?
