#### A photo journey of when I built a glider, crashed it, built a RC plane, crashed it too, then took it to Japan.



### What started it all  
Back in 2012, I had the opportunity to joined the YDSP World of Science Aerodynamics programme. It was a course spread over several months, held at NUS Engineering Faculty. The course culminated with a visit and flight experience at Singapore Youth Flying Club, and I certainly enjoyed my time then!

_Sitting in a Diamond DA40, waiting to takeoff._  

Near the end of the course, we were asked if anyone would be interested in doing a research project under the Research@YDSP programme with DSO, and I jumped at the chance. Together with 3 other group members, we embarked on this journey where we researched on constructing the most optimal glider with collapsible wings.  

Our very first glider was a simple one, to understand how gliders work. This was our very first glider:  

![First Glider]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/firstglider.jpg)  
_The first of many to come._  

The key thing in this project was the design of the closing/opening mechanism. We drew inspiration from a very common item found in most homes: Windows. Most of us had windows that can be opened or closed, and we decided to emulate its hinge design:  

![Hinge]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/window.png)  
_A typical window hinge._  

We moved on from there to our first prototype with deployable wings. You can see the carbon fibre rods that formed the skeleton of our hinge mechanism here:

There was several setbacks initially, especially when our plane broke:  

![Crash Landing]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/broke.gif)  
_Ouch._

_Back to the workshop..._  

But it gave us the opportunity to redesign the wing such that it could close even further:

_Final Prototype, wings folded. Note that the wing redesign allows for a smaller footprint._  

![Final Prototype Deployed]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/newdeployed.jpg)  
_Final Prototype, wings deployed. Note the winglets at the end, to reduce wing tip vertices._  

Here, we are using a software to track the moving pixels to assess the flight path of our glider.

6 months later, we were all done, and presented our project at the YDSP Research Congress.

Following that, we went on to submit our projects to the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, and was shortlisted to participate!

### We were having so much fun, why stop?  
We discussed with our research mentors at DSO, and 3 of us agreed to extend our project further. This time, we were going to build a full UAV. We discussed some potential designs:

![sketches]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sketches.jpg)  
_Whiteboard sketches._ 

I then started with some 3D modelling. Initially, I tried out Wings 3D.  

![3D Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3ddeployed.jpg)  
_Wings 3D model, wings deployed._

_Wings 3D model, disassembled._  

![3D Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3dfolded.jpg)  
_Wings 3D model, fully collapsed._  

The new model had a new hinge design, a pair of aluminium plates to guide the wings to fold back. The previous design was simply too fragile, and unable to handle the stress from rough landings. The new design also allows for the wings to be completely folded, parallel to the fuselage.  

I then moved to work on Solidworks, to further finalise the dimensions of my hinge design.

_Wing plate dimensions, solidworks model._

_Wings folded, Solidworks model._

I first tried to machine those plates myself, using a Dremel drill and metal plates bought at a local hardware store.

![Dremel Cut]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/handcut.jpg)  
_Balancing the wingplate on the proposed fuselage. Note the rough cutting._

The cut was simply too rough, and unusable for our purposes. Undeterred, I went on to try using a CNC machine to cut the plate.

![CNC Cut]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CNC.jpg)  
_CNC at work. Note once again the rough cutting._

Nope, still didn't work, and I broke at least 4 drill bits in this process. Left without a choice, we decided to outsource the production of the wingplates. In the meantime, I started work on the rest of the plane:

![Wings]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wing.jpg)  
_Marking out where to install servo motors, and where to cut ailerons on the wing. Note the reinforcing carbon fibre strip that runs through the wing._   

After the wingplates were delivered, we assembled the plane together. Finally our baby was born!

The maiden flight of our project:

_It flew... and promptly stalled. But it flew!_

After multiple crash landings:

Once again, we submitted our project to SSEF 2014, and was shortlisted to participate once more!

Once more at the YDSP Congress:

A few months later, I participated at West Zone Centre of Excellence for Science and Technology (WZCOE) Studentsâ€™ Science Symposium 2014, and presented my project. To my surprise, our project [won the Popularity Award](http://www.nushigh.edu.sg/about-us/achievements/2014/academic-competitions/nus-high-school-wins-popularity-award-at-the-west-zone-centre-of-excellence-for-science-and-technology-wzcoe-students-science-symposium-2014)! My enthusiasm must have been really infectious then.

_My team mates were absent that day due to other engagements, thus the lonely me._

The finale was when the school shortlisted my project to participate in the Japan Super Science Fair 2014, held at Ritsumeikan High School! It was my first time flying out of Singapore, and also my first trip to Japan. It was indeed a memorable experience, and it was from there that I grew to love travelling. The science fair featured research projects from all over the world, and I was able to interact with people from different countries. Certainly a unique experience!

My research journey was a long and exciting one, I would not trade it for any other. I am grateful that my school is supportive of such research efforts, and for letting us pursue our interests to such great lengths.
