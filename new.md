#### A brief history on my interactions with computers

### It all started...

...all the way back in Year 1 (Sec 1), when I entered NUS High. A few of us thought it would be funny to add a shortcut to shutdown.exe into a computer’s startup folder as a joke, and watch the confusion that ensued on the next unsuspecting user. It was a mischievous prank, but memorable: high school marked the first time I had regular access to a computer, and it was where the seeds were sowed.

### Then I got myself a Graphing Calculator
I promptly realised that it doubled as a portable programming machine. I spent half my bus rides hunched over my GC, coding on the small screen: physics functions, math utilities, even text based games.

### During my senior years
I was exposed to alot of things. I learnt the basics to C programming, and was also introduced to my first 
Linux distro. Initially running Linux in a virtual environment, I went on to dual boot my laptop. Following a critical failure of my hard disk, I then decided to fully install linux as my main OS for a good half a year... until compatibility issues forced me to switch back to Windows.

I went on to learn the basics of Python on my own accord, in an attempt to build my own "Search Engine". As expected, the result was a very slow and definitely not very comprehensive web crawler, but it did teach me the merits of Python.

### 3D Modeling my research project
As part of my research work, I also picked up 3D modelling on Solidworks. Find out more about my project here.

### Young Rewired State @ Google Singapore
In my last year of study, I joined a team to participate in the Young Rewired State Hackathon, held at Google Singapore, as a designer. Though not part of the programming team, it was still an eye opening experience for me, especially after we [clinched the Best Use of Code award.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150922162216/http://hacks.youngrewiredstate.org/events/yrssingapore) The project is still live [here.](http://sup-sg.appspot.com/) The project was a simple idea, which was to let people add and search for events near them.

### Enlistment, and then signing on in the Signals formation
After enlisting, my passion drove me to continue down this path in the Signals formation, as an Army regular. Already experienced in the setting up and running of complex networks, I joined my formation’s push for cyber defence, and was sent for a multitude of courses to attain the necessary skills, of which include:

* Certified Ethical Hacking
* Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator 
* Cyber Security Analyst 
* Cyber Security Incident Responder
* Cyber Security Operations Specialist.  

The last was my favourite; the final practical examination had us fending of live attacks in a virtualized network environment.
One of the attacks were as follows:The first inkling of trouble was when the IDS issued an alert for suspicious web crawling activities on the web host servers. Initially, dismissing it as a false positive, we soon found our DNS server was shutting down abruptly. After restarting the server and tracing the logs, we found the culprit to be... the SQL server? A subsequent investigation on the SQL server found that it was tampered with via the web host server, and it was only then we realised that we were looking at a SQL injection. Such attacks kept us constantly on our toes, and I greatly valued the learning opportunity given to us.

### Future Thoughts
The field of Information Systems is truly exciting, and I wish to have the chance to further my passion in this. My strong passion has led me on my knowledge pursuit, and in the future I wish to specialise in Cyber Security.
