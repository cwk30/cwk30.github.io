#### A brief history on my interactions with computers

  
line break?  
  
  
### It all started...

...all the way back in Year 1 (Sec 1), when I entered NUS High. A few of us thought it would be funny to add a shortcut to shutdown.exe into a computerâ€™s startup folder as a joke, and watch the confusion that ensued on the next unsuspecting user. It was a mischievous prank, but memorable: high school marked the first time I had regular access to a computer, and it was where the seeds were sowed.

### Then I got myself a Graphing Calculator
I promptly realised that it doubled as a portable programming machine. I spent half my bus rides hunched over my GC, coding on the small screen: physics functions, math utilities, even text based games.

### During my senior years
I was exposed to alot of things. I learnt the basics to C programming, and was also introduced to my first linux distro. Initially running linux in a virtual environment, I went on to dual boot my laptop. Following a critical failure of my hard disk, I then decided to fully install linux as my main OS for a good half a year... until compatibility issies forced me to switch back to Windows.

I went on to learn the basics of Python on my own accord, in an attempt to build my own "Search Engine". As expected, the result was a very slow and definitely not very comprehensive web crawler, but it did teach me the merits of Python.

As part of my research work, I also picked up 3D modelling on Solidworks. Find out more about my project here.

In my last year of study, I joined a team to participate in the Young Rewired State Hackathon, as a designer. Though not part of the programming team, it was still an eye opening experience for me,
