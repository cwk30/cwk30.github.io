A brief history on my interaction's with computers

### It all started...

...all the way back in Year 1 (Sec 1), when I entered NUS High. A few of thought it would be funny to add a shortcut to shutdown.exe into a computerâ€™s startup folder as a joke, and watch the confusion that ensued on the next unsuspecting user. It was a mischievous prank, but memorable: high school marked the first time I had regular access to a computer, and it was where the seeds were sowed.

### Then one day,
I got a graphing calculator - and realised that it doubled as a portable programming machine. I spent bus rides hunched over my GC, coding on the small screen: physics functions, math utilities, even text based games.
