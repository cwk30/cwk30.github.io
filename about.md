Hi! My name is Chua Wee Kian, and my friends call me James. I am a proud alumni of NUS High School, class of 2014, and am currently serving in the SAF, in the Signals formation. I used to be a regular specialist in the SAF, but was offered the chance to crossover as an officer in 2017. Currently in OCS, I will commission on June 16, 2018, and hopefully will be going to further my studies this year too. 

I love to tinker, and would consider myself technologically adept. A gadget guy, I have much interest in smart wearables and I constantly find myself trawling the pages of Kickstarter, in search of new gadgets. 

I am also an aspiring cook, and you may find me ~~burning up the kitchen~~ serving up my next creation on weekend afternoons. I'm always experimenting and trying new recipes, and my family and friends serve as my food critics.

I like to see myself as a globe trotter. I love to travel, and in the past 4 years, I have been to Australia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and Vietnam thus far. My favourite country to travel to so far is Japan, hands down. I hope to visit every country at least once!
