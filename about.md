Hi! My name is Chua Wee Kian, and my friends call me James. I am a proud alumni of NUS High School, class of 2014, and am currently serving in the SAF, in the Signals formation. I used to be a regular specialist in the SAF, but was offered the chance to crossover as an officer in 2017. Currently in OCS, I will commision on June 16, 2018, and hopefully will be going to further my studies this year too. 

I love to tinker, and would consider myself technologically adept. A gadget guy, I have much interest in smart wearables and I constantly find myself trawling the pages of Kickstarter, in search of new gadgets.

### Hobbies  
I love to cook, travel, and read. I try to cook at least once a week, and my friends and families serve as my food critics.  
Traveling wise, I have been to Australia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and Vietnam thus far. I hope to travel to every country at least once!  
Whenever I have some downtime, you will find me reading. It can be a good book, the latest news, or maybe even just random wikipedia pages.
