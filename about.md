### Hobbies  
I love to cook, travel, and read. I try to cook at least once a week, and my friends and families serve as my food critics.  
Traveling wise, I have been to Australia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and Vietnam thus far. I hope to travel to every country at least once!  
Whenever I have some downtime, you will find me reading. It can be a good book, the latest news, or maybe even just random wikipedia pages.
